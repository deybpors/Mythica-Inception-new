- Hey. I have a little bit of a problem now. I've been wanting to tell you this while you were washed up in the beach there that you're so beautiful. Now, can you you kill five monsters for my lunch? Feels so heavy complimenting you like that.
*   Thank you! Hell yeah I wanna kill monsters!
*   No.
- hmm
- -> END
